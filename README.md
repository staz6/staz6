Hello beutiful people!
Your average programmer joe with a vast array of knowledge in many different front-end and back-end languages, 
Microservices and Monolithic architectures, Dockers/Kubernetes containers,
Message brockers (RabbitMq,ZeroMq), Databases, Linux Operating systems, website hosting and
