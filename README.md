Your average programmer joe with a vast array of knowledge in many different front-end and back-end languages, 
Microservices and Monolithic architectures, Dockers/Kubernetes containers,
Message brockers (RabbitMq,ZeroMq), Databases, Linux Operating systems, website hosting and
maintenance.
YEP totally average, you might even find me wasting my life on hackthebox, also fk that one machine wasted like 5 hours trying to creack that one. :)
